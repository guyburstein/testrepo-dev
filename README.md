OWINGS MILLS, Md. – Ray Rice won't get another chance with the Baltimore Ravens after all. There's no guarantee he gets another chance from the NFL either.
The Ravens announced they've terminated Rice's contract Monday afternoon, hours after TMZ.com posted video of the embattled running back punching his then-fiancée during an altercation at an Atlantic City hotel in February.

A short time later, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced he has indefinitely suspended Rice based on the new video evidence, which figured to scare off any team that might have contemplated signing him anyway.

NFL spokesman Greg Aiello wouldn't say if Rice's ban is for a minimum of one year before he can apply for reinstatement under terms of the enhanced personal conduct policy Goodell announced last month in response to public outcry over Rice being suspended just two games.

"It's indefinite," Aiello wrote in an email to USA TODAY Sports.
